    <p>The first time I saw you I was shocked</p>
    <p>You were the key to a side of my heart that I kept locked</p>
    <p>I thought I was in a dream so I doublechecked</p>
    <p>Turns out you were real and every single time I saw you after that day I smirked</p> 
    <p>I hoped that one day I would get the courage to confess to you what I kept packed</p> 
    <p>I hoped that my heart and your heart were destined to be linked</p> 
    <p>I hoped that us being lovers was something that will happen unprovoked</p>
    <p>I hoped that one day we would go on romantic walks to escape reality as we talked</p>
    <p>I hoped that one day my life and your life would reach a position where it is interlocked</p>
