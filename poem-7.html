    <p>I’ve made up my mind, I am going to sweep these feelings under the rug </p>
    <p>Despite the pain it is going to leave or the huge pit that it had dug </p>
    <p>A pit that cannot be sealed, filled or closed by a plug </p>
    <p>But at least now if someone asks me do you like her I wouldn’t just shrug </p> 
    <p>I wouldn’t say that I am still waiting for the day I confess and her giving me a hug</p> 
    <p>I wouldn’t say that my love for her made me feel numb like some type of drug </p> 
    <p>I wouldn’t say that my heart was full of words just like water filling up a jug </p>
    <p>Yes, it is time to pack the feeling stuck in my heart that I thought no one can tug </p>
    <p>The feeling that I thought at first was smug </p>
