<p>There are memories that get etched into one’s mind</p>
<p>Mine is the day I met you it is the only day I wish to rewind</p> 
<p>But maybe it was better left as a memory behind</p>
<p>A memory that I can learn from although it may seem unkind</p> 
<p>I convinced myself that it is destiny and that it is a love story about to enwind</p>
<p>It seems that it is clear as day but I try to act blind </p>
<p>Trying to convince myself but maybe I am purblind</p>
<p>Because every time I try to explain it, it ends up with a “Never mind”</P>
