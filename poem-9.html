    <title>Unrequited love</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>I wish I could give you the ability to see yourself with my eyes</p>
<p>Then you would know why I feel that way and why I hate telling you goodbyes</p> 
<p>Sometimes I wish that the only thing I see is your face</p>
<p>Maybe then I wouldn’t feel the pain of missing you at that time and place</p> 
<p>Also, I wouldn’t sit there regretting what I didn’t do back then</p>
<p>Realizing that it would have been easier to tell you using a paper and a pen</p>
<p>Yet I didn’t, and now I cannot do anything about that</p>
<p>All I can do is act as if I am only your friend and chat</P>
<p>Maybe it is just a chain of events that will connect and it will all make sense</p>
<p>And one day in the future a successful love story would commence</p>
